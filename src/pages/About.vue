        <h2>Information about this tool</h2>
        <p>
            This app was created because of the limitations that I was running into from the website version found at 
            <a href="https://stevenaleong.com/tools/spotifyplaylistrandomizer" target="_blank">https://stevenaleong.com/tools/spotifyplaylistrandomizer</a>.
        </p>  
        <p>
            I was asked multiple times if there was a way to schedule the shuffling among other
            features that I could not implement into the tool without rebuilding it with all these
            requests in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            This gave me an excuse to learn new technologies. This tool was built using Electron and VueJS.

            I didn't build this app to sell. I built it because I was running into frustrations of Spotify. I got asked
            once by someone if they could send some money to me which I honestly never expected. I just wanted to share the
            tool that was originally created. I'm just happy people are using the tools and are letting me know!
        </p>

            If you're still feeling generous, please buy me a donut or a coffee!
