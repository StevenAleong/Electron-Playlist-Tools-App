                This app was created because of the limitations that I was running into from the website version found at 
                <a href="https://stevenaleong.com/tools/spotifyplaylistrandomizer" target="_blank">https://stevenaleong.com/tools/spotifyplaylistrandomizer</a>.
            </p>  
            <p>
                I was asked multiple times if there was a way to schedule the shuffling among other
                features that I could not implement into the tool without rebuilding it with all these
                requests in mind.
            </p>

                Never wanting to stay outdated, this gave me an excuse to learn new technologies. This tool
                was built using Electron and VueJS.
